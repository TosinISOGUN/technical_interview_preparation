## Synopsis
At ALX Holberton School of Software Engineering, specific questions/tasks are treated as interview prep tasks, these tasks are proven and can potentially be interview questions in the future while job hunting. This repository contains many of such prep tasks.

## File Contents
### Filename; **[`10-check_cycle.c`](https://github.com/TosinISOGUN/technical_interview_preparation/blob/main/10-check_cycle.c)**
- **Question;**
> Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

- Prototype: `int check_cycle(listint_t *list);`
- Return: `0` if there is no cycle, `1` if there is a cycle.

### Requirements:

Only these functions are allowed: `write`, `printf`, `putchar`, `puts`, `malloc`, `free`.

> **Answers can be found in the files therein!**

### Filename; **[`13-insert_number.c`](https://github.com/TosinISOGUN/technical_interview_preparation/blob/main/13-insert_number.c)**

- **Question;**
> Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

- Prototype: `listint_t *insert_node(listint_t **head, int number);`
- Return: the address of the new node, or `NULL` if it failed.

> **Answers can be found in the files therein!**

### Filename; **[`13-is_palindrome.c`](https://github.com/TosinISOGUN/technical_interview_preparation/blob/main/13-is_palindrome.c)**

- **Question;**
> Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

- Prototype: `int is_palindrome(listint_t **head);`
- Return: 0 if it is not a palindrome, 1 if it is a palindrome.
- An empty list is considered a palindrome.

> **Answers can be found in the files therein!**

### Filename; **[`lists.h`](https://github.com/TosinISOGUN/technical_interview_preparation/blob/main/lists.h)**
The `lists.h` file is a header file which contains all the standard and custom function prototypes used in solving `C programming` related interview prep tasks.
